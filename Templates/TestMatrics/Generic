# ðŸ“Š Test Metrics â€“ [Project Name]

This document provides the **key QA metrics** tracked during the testing lifecycle of the project.  
Metrics help in measuring **test progress, quality, and efficiency**.

---

## 1. Test Case Metrics
| Metric | Formula | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Total Test Cases** | Count of all designed test cases | 150 |
| **Executed Test Cases** | (Executed / Total) Ã— 100 | 120 / 150 = 80% |
| **Passed Test Cases** | (Passed / Executed) Ã— 100 | 100 / 120 = 83% |
| **Failed Test Cases** | (Failed / Executed) Ã— 100 | 20 / 120 = 17% |
| **Blocked Test Cases** | Count of blocked cases due to environment / dependency | 5 |

---

## 2. Defect Metrics
| Metric | Formula | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Defect Density** | Defects / Size of module (e.g., KLOC or Function Points) | 25 defects / 10 KLOC = 2.5 |
| **Defect Leakage** | (Defects in UAT / Total Defects) Ã— 100 | 5 / 50 = 10% |
| **Defect Reopen Rate** | (Reopened Defects / Total Fixed) Ã— 100 | 4 / 40 = 10% |
| **Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE)** | (Defects removed before release / Total Defects) Ã— 100 | 45 / 50 = 90% |

---

## 3. Test Execution Metrics
| Metric | Formula | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Test Execution Progress** | (Executed Test Cases / Planned Test Cases) Ã— 100 | 120 / 150 = 80% |
| **Test Case Productivity** | Test Cases Designed / Effort (hrs or days) | 50 / 2 days = 25 per day |
| **Automation Coverage** | (Automated Cases / Total Cases) Ã— 100 | 60 / 150 = 40% |

---

## 4. Quality Metrics
| Metric | Formula | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Requirement Coverage** | (Requirements Covered by Test Cases / Total Requirements) Ã— 100 | 45 / 50 = 90% |
| **Test Effectiveness** | (Defects found by QA / Total Defects) Ã— 100 | 45 / 50 = 90% |
| **Defect Severity Index (DSI)** | Î£ (Defect Severity Ã— Count) / Total Defects | (High=3Ã—10 + Medium=2Ã—20 + Low=1Ã—20) / 50 |

---

## 5. Schedule Metrics
| Metric | Formula | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Planned vs. Actual Execution** | (Actual Execution / Planned Execution) Ã— 100 | 85% vs 100% |
| **On-Time Delivery Rate** | (Milestones Met / Planned Milestones) Ã— 100 | 4 / 5 = 80% |

---

## 6. Reporting
- **Daily/Weekly Status Reports** shared with stakeholders.  
- Graphs used: Test Execution Trend, Defect Trend, Requirement Coverage.  
- Tools used: JIRA, TestRail, Excel Dashboards.

âœ… These metrics help stakeholders measure **quality, progress, and release readiness**.
